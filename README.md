```bash
# Pull and run Neo4j with APOC
docker run -d \
  --name umbc-neo4j \
  -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/yourpassword \
  -e NEO4J_PLUGINS='["apoc", "graph-data-science"]' \
  -e NEO4J_apoc_export_file_enabled=true \
  -e NEO4J_apoc_import_file_enabled=true \
  -e NEO4J_apoc_import_file_use__neo4j__config=true \
  -v $PWD/import:/var/lib/neo4j/import \
  neo4j:5-community
```

## Step 2: Generate the Synthetic Dataset

### Setup Python Environment
```bash
# Clone or download this repository
git clone https://github.com/jasonpaluck/hackumbc-2025.git
cd hackumbc-2025

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate Data
```bash
# Run the generator
python3 generate_synthetic_dataset.py

# This creates the umbc_data/ directory with:
# - CSV files for bulk import
# - Cypher scripts for direct import
# - README with data dictionary
# - Browser guide with example queries
```

## Step 3: Import Data into Neo4j

### Method 1: Using Cypher Scripts (Easiest for Hackathon)

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: The Cypher import process takes significant time due to the thousands of MATCH operations required to create relationships. Plan accordingly and start early!

1. Open Neo4j Browser (http://localhost:7474)
2. Login with your credentials
3. Run these commands in order:

```cypher
// First, clear any existing data (optional)
MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n;

// Create constraints and indexes (REQUIRED - run first!)
CREATE CONSTRAINT student_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (s:Student) REQUIRE s.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT course_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (c:Course) REQUIRE c.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT faculty_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (f:Faculty) REQUIRE f.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT degree_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (d:Degree) REQUIRE d.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT requirement_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (r:RequirementGroup) REQUIRE r.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT term_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (t:Term) REQUIRE t.id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT textbook_id IF NOT EXISTS FOR (tb:Textbook) REQUIRE tb.id IS UNIQUE;

// Create indexes for better query performance
CREATE INDEX student_learning_style IF NOT EXISTS FOR (s:Student) ON (s.learningStyle);
CREATE INDEX course_department IF NOT EXISTS FOR (c:Course) ON (c.department);
CREATE INDEX course_level IF NOT EXISTS FOR (c:Course) ON (c.level);
CREATE INDEX term_type IF NOT EXISTS FOR (t:Term) ON (t.type);
```

4. Import the Cypher files in order from `umbc_data/cypher/`:
   - Files 01-07: Node creation (fast)
   - Files 08-15: Basic relationships
   - Files 16-21: Large relationship sets (thousands of MATCH operations each)

üí° **Pro Tips**: 
- Start the import at the beginning of the hackathon while you plan your project
- You can skip the textbook interaction files (20-21) if you're not analyzing reading patterns
- Consider importing only a subset of the completed courses if you need faster setup

### Reducing Dataset Size (If Needed)

If you're running into memory/time constraints, modify these parameters in `generate_synthetic_dataset.py` before generating:

```python
# Line 34-40 - Reduce these values:
NUM_STUDENTS = 100        # Reduce from 500
NUM_COURSES = 50          # Reduce from 100  
AVG_COURSES_PER_STUDENT = 10  # Reduce from 20

# This will generate a smaller but still functional dataset
```

After modifying, regenerate the dataset:
```bash
python3 generate_synthetic_dataset.py
```

A smaller dataset will import much faster while still providing rich relationship patterns for your project!

### Method 2: Using CSV Import (For Large Datasets)
```bash
# Copy CSV files to Neo4j import directory
# For Neo4j Desktop: Find import directory in database settings
# For Docker: Already mapped to ./import

# Run this Cypher command in Neo4j Browser:
:auto USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///students.csv' AS row
CREATE (s:Student {
  id: row.id,
  name: row.name,
  enrollmentDate: date(row.enrollmentDate),
  expectedGraduation: date(row.expectedGraduation),
  learningStyle: row.learningStyle,
  preferredCourseLoad: toInteger(row.preferredCourseLoad),
  preferredPace: row.preferredPace,
  riskTolerance: toFloat(row.riskTolerance),
  careerGoal: row.careerGoal
});

// Continue with other CSV files...
```

## Step 4: Verify Import

Run this query to check your data:
```cypher
// Check node counts
MATCH (n) RETURN labels(n)[0] as Label, count(n) as Count;

// Should see approximately:
// Student: 500
// Course: 100
// Faculty: 30
// Degree: 4
// Term: 12
// Textbook: 80-100
```

## Step 5: View Browser Guide

1. Open the HTML file `umbc_data/umbc_guide.html` for additional insights.

## Data Model

The database follows this graph model:

- **Nodes**: Student, Course, Faculty, Degree, RequirementGroup, Term, Textbook
- **Relationships**:
  - Student-Course: COMPLETED, ENROLLED_IN
  - Student-Degree: PURSUING
  - Student-Student: SIMILAR_LEARNING_STYLE, SIMILAR_PERFORMANCE
  - Course-Course: PREREQUISITE_FOR, LEADS_TO, SIMILAR_CONTENT, SIMILAR_DIFFICULTY
  - Faculty-Course: TEACHES
  - RequirementGroup-Degree: PART_OF
  - Course-RequirementGroup: FULFILLS
  - Course-Term: OFFERED_IN
  - Course-Textbook: REQUIRES, RECOMMENDS
  - Student-Textbook: VIEWED_PAGE, INTERACTED_WITH

## üîó Student Similarity Relationships - The Key to Behavioral Insights

The dataset includes two powerful student similarity relationships that enable peer-based analytics:

### **SIMILAR_LEARNING_STYLE** Relationship
- Connects students with matching learning styles (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Reading-Writing)
- Similarity score (0.1-1.0) based on:
  - Learning style match (base 0.7)
  - Preferred pace match (+0.1)
  - Instruction mode preference (+0.1)
  - Course load similarity (adjusted)

### **SIMILAR_PERFORMANCE** Relationship  
- Connects students who took 3+ common courses
- Similarity score (0.1-1.0) calculated from:
  - 70% weight: Grade similarity across common courses
  - 30% weight: Difficulty perception alignment
- Includes list of common courses in the relationship

### **The Power of Similarity: Behavioral Change Recommendations**

**Core Insight Question**: *"Students most similar to you who are performing better are behaving differently. What specific changes could you make to improve your academic performance?"*

This is the foundation for powerful recommendation systems. Here's how to approach it:

### Example: Comprehensive Behavioral Analysis Query

```cypher
// Find what successful similar students do differently
// First get a sample student who has course completions
MATCH (target:Student)-[:COMPLETED]->(:Course)
WITH target.id AS targetStudentId LIMIT 1  // Get first student with courses

// Get target student's GPA equivalent
MATCH (target:Student {id: targetStudentId})-[tc:COMPLETED]->(c:Course)
WITH target, targetStudentId, 
     AVG(CASE tc.grade
         WHEN 'A' THEN 4.0 WHEN 'A-' THEN 3.7
         WHEN 'B+' THEN 3.3 WHEN 'B' THEN 3.0 WHEN 'B-' THEN 2.7
         WHEN 'C+' THEN 2.3 WHEN 'C' THEN 2.0 WHEN 'C-' THEN 1.7
         WHEN 'D+' THEN 1.3 WHEN 'D' THEN 1.0
         ELSE 0 END) AS targetGPA

// Find similar students who are performing better
MATCH (target)-[sim:SIMILAR_LEARNING_STYLE|SIMILAR_PERFORMANCE]->(peer:Student)
WHERE sim.similarity > 0.7
MATCH (peer)-[pc:COMPLETED]->(course:Course)
WITH target, targetGPA, peer, sim,
     AVG(CASE pc.grade
         WHEN 'A' THEN 4.0 WHEN 'A-' THEN 3.7
         WHEN 'B+' THEN 3.3 WHEN 'B' THEN 3.0 WHEN 'B-' THEN 2.7
         WHEN 'C+' THEN 2.3 WHEN 'C' THEN 2.0 WHEN 'C-' THEN 1.7
         WHEN 'D+' THEN 1.3 WHEN 'D' THEN 1.0
         ELSE 0 END) AS peerGPA
WHERE peerGPA > targetGPA + 0.3  // At least 0.3 GPA points higher

// Analyze behavioral differences in multiple dimensions
MATCH (peer)-[peerCompleted:COMPLETED]->(course:Course)

// 1. Course Load Analysis
WITH target, peer, 
     COUNT(DISTINCT peerCompleted) AS peerCourseCount,

OPTIONAL MATCH (target)-[targetView:VIEWED_PAGE]->(tTextbook:Textbook)
OPTIONAL MATCH (target)-[targetInt:INTERACTED_WITH]->(tTextbook2:Textbook)
WHERE targetInt.interactionType IN ['highlight', 'note']

WITH peer, peerGPA,
     // Peer metrics
     peerCourseCount, peerPerceivedDifficulty, peerTextbookViews, 
     peerTextbooksUsed, peerAvgReadingDuration, peerActiveStudyInteractions,
     // Target metrics
     COUNT(DISTINCT targetCompleted) AS targetCourseCount,
     AVG(targetCompleted.difficulty) AS targetPerceivedDifficulty,
     COUNT(targetView) AS targetTextbookViews,
     COUNT(DISTINCT tTextbook) AS targetTextbooksUsed,
     AVG(targetView.duration) AS targetAvgReadingDuration,
     COUNT(targetInt) AS targetActiveStudyInteractions

// Calculate behavioral differences and generate recommendations
RETURN 
    // Performance Gap
    ROUND(AVG(peerGPA - targetGPA), 2) AS gpaGap,
    COUNT(DISTINCT peer) AS similarSuccessfulPeers,
    
    // Course Load Insights
    ROUND(AVG(peerCourseCount - targetCourseCount)) AS coursesPerTermDifference,
    CASE 
        WHEN AVG(peerCourseCount) > AVG(targetCourseCount) 
        THEN 'Take ' + toString(ROUND(AVG(peerCourseCount - targetCourseCount))) + ' more courses per term'
        WHEN AVG(peerCourseCount) < AVG(targetCourseCount)
        THEN 'Reduce course load by ' + toString(ROUND(AVG(targetCourseCount - peerCourseCount))) + ' courses'
        ELSE 'Course load is optimal'
    END AS courseLoadRecommendation,
    
    // Textbook Engagement Insights
    ROUND(AVG(peerTextbookViews - targetTextbookViews)) AS textbookEngagementGap,
    CASE 
        WHEN AVG(peerTextbookViews) > AVG(targetTextbookViews) * 1.5
        THEN 'Increase textbook reading by ' + toString(ROUND((AVG(peerTextbookViews) / AVG(targetTextbookViews) - 1) * 100)) + '%'
        ELSE 'Textbook engagement is sufficient'
    END AS textbookRecommendation,
    
    // Study Behavior Insights
    ROUND(AVG(peerAvgReadingDuration - targetAvgReadingDuration), 1) AS readingDurationGap,
    CASE 
        WHEN AVG(peerAvgReadingDuration) > AVG(targetAvgReadingDuration)
        THEN 'Spend ' + toString(ROUND(AVG(peerAvgReadingDuration - targetAvgReadingDuration))) + ' more minutes per reading session'
        ELSE 'Reading session duration is good'
    END AS readingDurationRecommendation,
    
    // Active Learning Insights
    ROUND(AVG(peerActiveStudyInteractions - targetActiveStudyInteractions)) AS activeStudyGap,

        WHEN AVG(targetPerceivedDifficulty) > AVG(peerPerceivedDifficulty) + 0.5
        THEN 'Similar students find courses easier - consider seeking study groups or tutoring'
        ELSE 'Difficulty perception aligns with successful peers'
    END AS difficultyInsight
```

### Simpler Targeted Queries

**Find Study Buddies Who Succeeded in Your Struggling Course:**
```cypher
// Find peers who aced a course you're struggling with
// First find a student with a low grade in any course
MATCH (you:Student)-[yourGrade:COMPLETED]->(course:Course)
WHERE yourGrade.grade IN ['C', 'C-', 'D', 'F']
WITH you, course, yourGrade LIMIT 1  // Get first example
MATCH (you)-[sim:SIMILAR_LEARNING_STYLE]->(peer:Student)-[peerGrade:COMPLETED]->(course)
WHERE sim.similarity > 0.8 
  AND peerGrade.grade IN ['A', 'A-', 'B+']
RETURN peer.id, peer.name, peerGrade.grade, sim.similarity,
       peerGrade.studyHours - yourGrade.studyHours AS extraStudyHours
ORDER BY sim.similarity DESC
```

**Identify Optimal Course Combinations Based on Similar Students:**
```cypher
// What course combinations work well for students like you?
// First get a student with similar learning style connections
MATCH (you:Student)-[:SIMILAR_LEARNING_STYLE]->(peer:Student)
WITH you LIMIT 1  // Get first student with similarity connections
MATCH (you)-[sim:SIMILAR_LEARNING_STYLE]->(peer:Student)
WHERE sim.similarity > 0.75
MATCH (peer)-[c1:COMPLETED]->(course1:Course), 
      (peer)-[c2:COMPLETED]->(course2:Course)
WHERE c1.term = c2.term  // Taken in same term
  AND c1.grade IN ['A', 'A-', 'B+']
  AND c2.grade IN ['A', 'A-', 'B+']
WITH course1, course2, COUNT(DISTINCT peer) AS successfulPeers
WHERE successfulPeers >= 3
RETURN course1.name, course2.name, successfulPeers
ORDER BY successfulPeers DESC
```

These similarity relationships transform the dataset from static academic records into a dynamic recommendation engine that can provide personalized, evidence-based advice for student success!

## Example Queries and Use Cases

### 1. Find Optimal Next Courses for a Student

```cypher
// Find optimal next courses based on learning style and prerequisites

MATCH (term:Term)
WHERE term.startDate > date()  // Get future term
WITH student, term, degree ORDER BY term.startDate LIMIT 1
MATCH (course:Course)-[:OFFERED_IN]->(term)
MATCH (course)-[:FULFILLS]->(:RequirementGroup)-[:PART_OF]->(degree)

// Ensure prerequisites are met
WHERE NOT EXISTS {
  MATCH (prereq:Course)-[:PREREQUISITE_FOR]->(course)
  WHERE NOT (student)-[:COMPLETED]->(prereq)
}

// Student hasn't already completed the course
AND NOT (student)-[:COMPLETED]->(course)

// Find similar students and their experiences with these courses
OPTIONAL MATCH (student)-[sim:SIMILAR_LEARNING_STYLE]->(similar:Student)-[comp:COMPLETED]->(course)
WHERE sim.similarity > 0.7

WITH student, course, term, degree,
     CASE WHEN COUNT(comp) > 0 
          THEN AVG(comp.difficulty)

// Find students who might be at risk based on textbook interaction patterns
MATCH (student:Student)-[comp:COMPLETED]->(course:Course)
MATCH (course)-[:REQUIRES]->(textbook:Textbook)
OPTIONAL MATCH (student)-[view:VIEWED_PAGE]->(textbook)
WITH student, course, textbook,
     COUNT(view) AS totalViews,
     COLLECT(view.timestamp) AS viewTimes
WITH student, course,
     AVG(totalViews) AS avgViewsPerTextbook,
     CASE WHEN size(viewTimes) > 0
          THEN reduce(s = 0, t in viewTimes |
               s + CASE WHEN size(viewTimes) > 0 
                    THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / CASE WHEN size(viewTimes) > 0 THEN size(viewTimes) ELSE 1 END
          ELSE 0 END AS examWeekRatio
WHERE (examWeekRatio > 0.7 OR avgViewsPerTextbook < 10) AND avgViewsPerTextbook > 0
RETURN student.id,
       student.name,
       COUNT(DISTINCT course) AS coursesAtRisk,
       ROUND(AVG(avgViewsPerTextbook)) AS avgTextbookViews,
       ROUND(AVG(examWeekRatio) * 100) AS percentageLastMinuteReading
ORDER BY coursesAtRisk DESC, avgTextbookViews ASC
```

**Use Case**: Early Intervention

OPTIONAL MATCH (student)-[interact:INTERACTED_WITH]->(textbook)
WITH course, textbook,
     COUNT(DISTINCT student) AS totalStudents,
     AVG(CASE WHEN comp.grade IN ['A', 'A-', 'B+'] THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS successRate,
     AVG(CASE WHEN view IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS readingRate,
     AVG(CASE WHEN interact.interactionType = 'highlight' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS highlightRate,
     AVG(CASE WHEN interact.interactionType = 'note' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS noteRate
RETURN course.name,
       textbook.name,
       totalStudents,
       ROUND(successRate * 100) AS successPercentage,
       ROUND(readingRate * 100) AS readingPercentage,

- Complex pattern matching across multiple relationship types (learning style, course completion, textbook usage)

**Key Metrics**:
- Page View Differences: Compares total pages read between target and similar students
- Reading Days: Analyzes how reading is distributed across time
- Session Duration: Examines typical reading session lengths
- Reading Consistency: Measures regularity of reading habits
- Reading Intensity: Evaluates overall reading engagement

**Returned Columns**:
- courseId/courseName: Identifies the course being analyzed
- numberOfSimilarStudents: Number of similar students used for comparison
- Various Recommendations: Personalized advice for improving reading habits
- Difference Metrics: Detailed comparisons with similar students' patterns

## Common Queries for Hackathon

### Find Sample IDs to Test Queries

**Important**: All example queries now use dynamic ID selection, but you can also use specific IDs:
```cypher
// Get a random student who has completed courses and is pursuing a degree
MATCH (s:Student)-[:PURSUING]->(d:Degree)
WHERE EXISTS((s)-[:COMPLETED]->(:Course))
RETURN s.id, s.name, d.name, COUNT{(s)-[:COMPLETED]->(:Course)} as coursesCompleted
LIMIT 10
```

### Find Available Terms
```cypher
// List all terms in the database
MATCH (t:Term)
RETURN t.id, t.name, t.startDate, t.endDate
ORDER BY t.startDate DESC
```

### Explore Course Prerequisites
```cypher
// Show prerequisite chains for Computer Science courses
MATCH path = (prereq:Course)-[:PREREQUISITE_FOR*1..3]->(course:Course)
WHERE course.department = 'Computer Science'
RETURN path
LIMIT 25
```

### Student Performance Analysis
```cypher
// Find high-performing students to learn from
MATCH (s:Student)-[c:COMPLETED]->(course:Course)
WHERE c.grade IN ['A', 'A-']
WITH s, COUNT(DISTINCT course) as excellentCourses
WHERE excellentCourses > 5
RETURN s.id, s.name, s.learningStyle, excellentCourses
ORDER BY excellentCourses DESC
LIMIT 10
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Import Errors

**Problem**: "Couldn't load the external resource"
**Solution**: 
- Ensure Neo4j has started completely before running queries
- Check that APOC plugin is installed and enabled
- For CSV import, verify files are in the correct import directory

**Problem**: "Constraint already exists"
**Solution**:
- This is fine! The IF NOT EXISTS clause should handle it
- If it still errors, you can skip constraint creation if they already exist

#### 2. Memory Issues

**Problem**: "Java heap space" or slow queries
**Solution**:
```bash
# Increase Neo4j heap memory in neo4j.conf:
dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=2G
dbms.memory.heap.max_size=4G
dbms.memory.pagecache.size=2G
```

#### 3. Python Generator Issues

**Problem**: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'faker'"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Reinstall requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Problem**: Generator runs but no output
**Solution**:
- Check that you have write permissions in the directory
- Look for the `umbc_data/` folder after running
- Check console for any error messages

#### 4. Query Performance

**Problem**: Queries are running slowly
**Solution**:
1. Ensure indexes are created (see Step 3)
2. Use EXPLAIN or PROFILE to analyze query:
```cypher
PROFILE MATCH (s:Student)-[:COMPLETED]->(c:Course)
RETURN COUNT(*)
```
3. Add more specific WHERE clauses to limit data early
4. Consider using LIMIT during testing

#### 5. Timestamp Issues in Queries

**Note**: The generated timestamps are in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" format. When working with temporal queries, use:
```cypher
// Convert string timestamp to datetime
datetime(replace(timestamp_string, ' ', 'T'))

// Example:
WITH '2023-09-15 14:30:00' AS ts
RETURN datetime(replace(ts, ' ', 'T')) AS converted_datetime
```

## Tips for Hackathon Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic queries before attempting complex ones
2. **Use the Browser Guide**: The included HTML guide has tested queries
3. **Leverage Indexes**: Always create indexes before importing large datasets
4. **Test with LIMIT**: Add LIMIT to queries during development
5. **Explore Relationships**: Use the visualization to understand connections
6. **Check Node Properties**: Use `MATCH (n:NodeType) RETURN keys(n) LIMIT 1` to see available properties
